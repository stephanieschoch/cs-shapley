Official code repository for the NeurIPS 2022 paper "CS-Shapley: Class-wise Shapley Values for Data Valuation in Classification"

## We recently released a new Python package: [Valda](https://uvanlp.org/valda/). Valda contains implementations for several data valuation methods, including our code for CS-Shapley. Please check out the tutorial and source while we finalize documentation for this repo.
